<h2>Why</h2>
<p>With <a class='Link' href='https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_releases/articles/more_than_300,000_people_in_britain_homeless_today '>300,000 homeless</a>, over <a class='Link' href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49787913 '>8 million </a><a class='Link' href='https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/23/people-england-living-unsuitable-housing'>live in unsustainable housing </a>that is not fit as human shelter, and half of england owned by only <a class='Link' href='https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/apr/17/who-owns-england-thousand-secret-landowners-author'>around 25,000 </a>landowners, it becomes clear that not only is our housing market unfair, but it is failing those most vulnerable in our society.</p>
<br>
<p>Housing costs (excluding mortgages) make up <a class='Link' href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45559456 '>30% </a>of the young people's income, as well as <a class='Link' href='https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc773/treemap/index.html'>13.6% </a>of all households spending. Meanwhile those who do own their homes, and are mortgage free, are typically those who bought their homes in the 60s and 70s, with a much lower proportion of young people owning property at all. Those who do are advantaged over those without. Since people earning the same salary have radically different disposable incomes depending on whether they own the home, pay their mortgage or rent - leading to a divide in quality of life based on what should be a human right.</p>
<br>
<p>When a landlord takes rent, the cost is ultimately split between the cost of maintaining the house, logistics fees for various companies (check) and profit for the landlord. 
In a nationalised there is no need to profit off of housing, thought there may be a desire to take additional funds for investment in other services, or in the creation of new homes. This means that the system must fundamentally be cheaper, more efficient, and better for the people. better choice of word for the last one</p>
<br>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>While there is some legislation for the government to take land away from private ownership, these laws have not been used in peacetime. Hence it is likely new legislation will need to be created to put the land under state ownership.</p>
<br>
<p>Firstly the ownership of all homes and land will be transferred to the government. The adult members of each household will be given 'personal' ownership of thier homes. Importantly, the landlord will only recieve personal ownership of their own residence, and anyone renting now has personal ownership of the home they live in.</p>
<br>
<p>Personal ownership will have protections written into law that prevent the occupents and their dependants (such as children) from being evicted, as well as the right to a home with access to electricity, heating, internet, running water, adequate space and all other requirements for a high quality of life. </p>
<br>
<p>Taxes will be increased for the cost of maintaining homes and the construction of new infrastructure. Over time new housing and infrastructure will be built, and those in the worst housing will be given the first opportunity to move out, to provide for those in the aforementioned poor housing.</p>
<br>
<p>Councils will be given the main role in maintaining homes and forming links with plumbers electricians etc. Any money not spent on maintaining and creating new homes each year can either be put into the NHS, local projects or saved in case of disasters.
The system for moving house - whether for jobs, marriage or having kids - will be implemented nationwide with the aim of keeping waiting times low.</p>
<br>
<h2>The costs</h2>
<p>Stamp duty, on average, brought in £<span style='color:var(--nord13)'>11.6 billion </span><a class='Link' href='https://www.statista.com/statistics/284328/stamp-duty-land-tax-united-kingdom-hmrc-tax-receipts/'>per year since 2015</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>The cost of maintaining a home in 2013 was £<span style='color:var(--nord13)'>716 </span>per month, with a 5 year percentage change of 19% - giving a cost of £<span style='color:var(--nord13)'>852.04 </span>per month. There are 23 million homes in the UK, leaving us with a total cost per year of £<span style='color:var(--nord13)'>235.2bn </span>per year to maintain. <a class='Link' href='https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/globalassets/documents/media/press-releases/halifax/2013/0304_running.pdf '>mirror </a></p>
<br>
<p>However some previous costs are saved, such as housing benefit, which costs taxpayers £<span style='color:var(--nord13)'>22bn </span>per year. <a class='Link' href='https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/doubling-of-the-housing-benefit-bill-is-sign-of-something-deeply-wrong-2qqwrb62r'>source.</a></p>
<br>
<p>The net cost is the maintainence + loss of stamp duty - cost of housing benefit = £<span style='color:var(--nord13)'>224.8bn</span>.</p>
<br>
<p>The number of tax payers 2020-21 will be <a class='Link' href='https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895197/Income_Tax_Liabilities_Statistics_June_2020_-_Commentary.pdf'>32.3 million</a>, meaning that if we split the cost at a flat rate per person the total cost comes to £<span style='color:var(--nord13)'>6960 </span>a year.</p>
<br>
<p>However a flat tax is not the solution. Instead we can increase the tax rates on both corporation tax - which is unacceptably low at 19%, as well as increasing tax rates on high earners.</p>

<p>Corporation tax brought in £<span style='color:var(--nord13)'>48.5bn</span>/year on <a class='Link' href='https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/corporation-tax-statistics-2019 '>average since 2015 </a>. As corportation tax is at 19% we can work out that the total taxable money from corporations is currently £<span style='color:var(--nord13)'>254.7bn</span>, ignoring any gains that could be made from closing tax avoidance loopholes.</p>
<br>
<p>Similarly the total amount of money made from each tax band can be calculated from <a class='Link' href='https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895661/Collated_Tables_2.1-2.7.xlsx'>this data</a>.

<p>At these rates the government also recieves an additional £<span style='color:var(--nord13)'>190,000,000 </span>a year. Since the government will also own office blocks and other buildings, the costs could be further subsidised by letting out some areas to buisnesses for a fee.</p>
<br>
<h2>Further Benefits </h2>
<p>Not only does the system give security and x to millions within the UK, it has other social benefits. One cannot be priced out of the towns, cities and villages which they grew up in, if they wish to remain. When a loved one passes sadly away, priority can be given to their children to allow important places to stay with families, rather than being lost to debt or the cost of maintenance.</p>
<br>
<p>When further construction of housing, whether in cities or villages, public good can be prioritised rather than profit. Sustainable buildings that are designed with the environment in mind can be built with solar panels on top to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. New schools, parks and GPs can be built with towns to keep waiting times low and to reduce catchment areas. Sensible roads and public transport links can be built to make everywhere more accessible.</p>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<p>The benefits are clear, this is a system which is both cheaper and less cruel, assists both the middle and the working class, both the young and the old. Only by moving forwards and creating systems which emphasise compassion, not cruelty, can we move forwards and solve the deepest problems in our society.</p>
